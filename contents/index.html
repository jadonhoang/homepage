                About Me
            </p>

            <p class="about-me-1">
                My name is Jadon I am currently a student majoring in computer science. During my years in community college, I have taken classes such as
                Intro to Computer Science, Intro to Java Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and a Micro Assembly Language class. My ultimate end goal is
                to become a game developer. I aspire to develop games that are entertaining, enjoyable, and action-packed. I want to create games that will
                resonate with a person much like how the games I played resonated with me.
            </p>

            <p class="about-me-2">
                Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, obviously. One of my all-time favorite games is
                the Pokemon series, specifically Pokemon Platinum. Pokemon Platinum is my favorite out of all the other ones because it was the one I grew up playing.
                Other than Pokemon, I always have fun playing Minecraft. Minecraft is another game I grew up playing and is the kind of game that I could never get bored of.
                Besides video games, I like listening to music, eating delicious food, and napping.
