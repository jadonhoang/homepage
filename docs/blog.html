                            So far, Kickstart coding has been an exiciting journey. I have been learning HTML and CSS which are languages that I've never learned before
                            and it is really fun. I am using those languages right now to build this homepage, along with bootstrap to strap everything up. I can't wait to
                            see what else this journey entails because I know I am going to be learning lots!

                            I just finished two years of community college and my process of transferring to another school didn't go too well. I applied to 4 different
                            UC's and unfortunately, three out of the four schools did not accept me and I was put on the waitlist for UC Davis, my dream school.
                            After accepting the waitlist position, I waited two months only to hear back from them that I did not get in as well. Things are looking a little
                            bit south for me but I still have hopes that I will get into UC Davis next year. In the mean time, I'll be expanding my knowledge of computer science at
                            Kickstart Coding and have plans to take an extra class at my community college in the fall.
